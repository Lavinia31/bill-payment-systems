# bill-payment-systems

In this project, a comprehensive bill payment system was developed, providing a complete billing environment and maintaining a history of bills and payments made. The primary objectives were:

Creating a system for bill payments.
Maintaining a record of client payments and bills.
System Architecture
The system's architecture includes several key components:

Core Application: Handles client creation, bill import, bill payment initiation, B2B/B2C processing, balance updates, and payment method updates.

Kafka Consumer Application: Manages bill payments by ID and bulk bill payments.

Frontend: Provides the interface between the application and the client, enabling bill payments, viewing payment and bill history, and adding an artificial balance to the system.
